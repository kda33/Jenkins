We manually delete with crontab. 
This is a very dirty way, but it works and stabilizes the CPU consumption of Jenkins. 
Please take your own responsibility for enabling this command.

crontab -e

1 1 1 1-12 * cd /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/ && find . -type d -name "*_ws-cleanup_*" -exec rm -rf {} +


Crontab explanation:

“At 01:01 on day-of-month 1 in every month from January through December.”
